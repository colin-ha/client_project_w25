            <p>The University of Michigan wants to encourage students to spend valuable time working towards their
                education.
                For this reason, there are
                many quality and accessible study spaces available to students on campus. In many cases, reservations
                are not
                needed, and students are free
                to simply show up, and get to work. Often you will find resources to help you succeed, such as power
                supplies,
                computer stations, remote-class attendance spaces, and more.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The University publishes a list of study spaces on an interactive guide. In most cases, reservations are
                not
                required. There are also many more
                study spaces around campus than just the ones listed here, and in most cases, the University is more
                than happy
                to allow you to study wherever works best for you, as long as it doesn't interfere with other
                events.</p>
