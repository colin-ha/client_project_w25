    <p>The University of Michigan wants to encourage students to spend valuable time working towards their education.
        For this reason, there are
        many quality and accessible study spaces available to students on campus. In many cases, reservations are not
        needed, and students are free
        to simply show up, and get to work. Often you will find resources to help you succeed, such as power supplies,
        computer stations, remote-class attendance spaces, and more.</p>

    <p>The University publishes a list of study spaces on an interactive guide. In most cases, reservations are not
        required. There are also many more
        study spaces around campus than just the ones listed here, and in most cases, the University is more than happy
        to allow you to study wherever works best for you, as long as it doesn't interfere with other events.</p>
