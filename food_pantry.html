    <p>The Maize and Blue Cupboard is a resource available to students who may be struggling with
        food insecurity or physical restraints that limit their access to food.
        The university believes it is the basic right of every person to be well-fed at all times,
        and that healthy eating is essential for success in and out of the classroom. </p>

    <p>The food pantry is located in the basement of the Betsy Barbour residence hall. They ask
        that all students enter via the Maynard entrance to protect resident privacy. More information
        is available at their website.</p>
