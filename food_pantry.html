            <p>The Maize and Blue Cupboard is a resource available to students who may be struggling with
                food insecurity or physical restraints that limit their access to food.
                The university believes it is the basic right of every person to be well-fed at all times,
                and that healthy eating is essential for success in and out of the classroom. </p>
